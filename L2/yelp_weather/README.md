# Determining the relationship between weather and Yelp review ratings

The goal of this project is to observe the relationship between weather and it's effect on restaurant reviews.  

## Datasets
The data for temperature and precipitation observations are from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) database. Data for restaurant reviews will be downloaded from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download). All parts of this project will be conducted using Snowflake. Data will be migrated into a staging environment, processed into tables in ODS, and then architected into a star schema-based data warehouse for analysis.
